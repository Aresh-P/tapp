   "cat" : 2,
   "notes" : "burroughs-mcp.html",
   "desc" : "The Burroughs large systems and their operating sytstem (MCP) pioneered many features that we take for granted including virtual memory, multitasking, the NX-bit, and an OS written in a higher level language ... all back in the 1960s! They also had many features which modern systems lack, such as hardware enforced type safety and immunity to buffer overflows. This talk will explain all the above and more."

   "cat" : 3,
   "notes" : "rust.html",
   "desc" : "Writing software is dangerous work. Race conditions, buffer overflows, and memory corruption can all compromise the functionality and security of programs that you write. Some languages eliminate these errors at the cost of performance, but is there a way to get the best of both worlds? Rust brings together the speed of C, the usability of Python, and the provable safety of Haskell, in one well-engineered programming language."
