   "desc" : "FPGAs are revolutionizing the computing industry by allowing logic designers to reconfigure circuitry on the fly, allowing for rapid development of new hardware where an ASIC would be prohibitively costly or impractical. But how does it all work? Can software-like code be used to design hardware?"

   "desc" : "What do you get when you combine a car with a computer? A computer that can cause life-threatening problems! Modern vehicles are massively complex computing platforms, with nearly one hundred processors and over a million lines of code. The complexity is only growing, especially as car manufacturers rush to add \"app stores\" to their dashboards and allow the owner to download potentially buggy software from the internet!  How do you design a system to protect the people inside (and outside) from harm while still allowing user-downloaded content? It starts with designing a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) that can guarantee separation of important safety-critical code from code that cannot be verified or trusted.  In this tech talk, we'll discuss dealing with the complexity of mixed-criticality systems through strict separation of execution time, memory-space, and resources."

We'll showcase a few of these intentionally confusing languages, and share some advice for actually writing code in them."
