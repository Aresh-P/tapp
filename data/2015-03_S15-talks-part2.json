In this talk, we will go over the basics of C++ and discuss design patterns and idioms, such as Resource Acquisition is Initialization, which can be used to develop robust, performant, and elegant code. We will also cover some of the new features in C++11 such as lambdas and move semantics."

It makes it trivially easy to use Java libraries and programs in a language that doesn't suck.  It is the most popular alternative to using Java on the JVM.  It is basically the best thing ever.
