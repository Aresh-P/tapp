In this talk, we will present several slick workflows which allow you to accomplish tasks quickly and efficiently from the command line, from grabbing videos off of YouTube from easily switching between running, compiling, and testing your code."

      "desc" : "Docker and Fig are cool technologies that allow you to compartmentalize your production workflow in any language.  However, we'll discuss how we can use these technologies to improve your development cycle, as well!  While we'll be \"Dockerizing\" a Node.js application, the lessons are applicable to all of the main web development platforms.  A basic background with webapps is helpful, but not necessary.  No Docker experience needed."

      "desc" : "Check out the language sensation sweeping the nation!  Not really, but Coffeescript is a good way to dramatically increase legibility, avoid some Javascript pitfalls, and otherwise make developing on the client and server easier.  We'll open with a discussion of Coffee syntax and set up of the development platform, then run through applying it to the client with JQuery, and on the server with Node.js.  JavaScript syntax background is needed."

To fulfill this requirement, Vim comes completely unconfigured--it's a blank slate. The problem is, not everyone's an advanced user! An unconfigured Vim is all but unusable. As it turns out, configuring Vim is very straightforward! In this talk, we'll introduce you to Vim plugins using the plugin manager Vundle. Our goal will be to walk out with a fully configured Vim setup. This includes a pleasant color scheme, fancy status bar indicators, code-aware features, Git integration, and more! Vim has a solution to handle just about anything that a normal IDE would. It's just about knowing where to start."

We'll briefly go over how Node.js is different from other platforms like Rails and Django (besides using JavaScript) and when it's best to use it.  Then we'll dive in to using Express and Mongo with Jade templating to make a MEN stack application.  When you leave, you should be able to build your own web-apps in Node.js.  Background in JavaScript syntax is helpful, but not necessary.  No web-app experience neeeded."
